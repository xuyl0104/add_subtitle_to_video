00:00
and a big fire there as they exited out
00:03
of turn three and that looks very nasty
00:05
indeed
00:06
this this was a big one is he okay i've
00:09
seen it to the mirrors no
00:11
please
00:12
is everyone okay is he out
00:15
how's he gonna help oh tell him he's
00:17
okay please tell me he's okay are they
00:19
okay i see you're fired is everyone
00:21
alright this car is on the player
00:24
he's out
00:26
is he is he okay
00:29
i could feel my hands with burning you
00:30
know where normally when you that you
00:32
touch something hot you would you touch
00:33
it and remove it but i would i would
00:35
keep my hands straight into the fire
00:37
because that's the only
00:39
grip i had to jump out of the car
00:41
my foot was stuck and i was pulling so
00:43
hard on my leg that even my ankle could
00:45
have stayed there i wouldn't care you
00:46
know i just wanted to be out of the car
00:48
at one point i thought that was it that
00:50
was my day you know
00:51
that was game over
00:55
hi roman thank you so much for taking
00:56
the time for a chat where are we finding
00:58
you
00:59
hey hey hi i'm you know i'm i'm good i'm
01:02
i'm back in switzerland where i uh i
01:04
live with the family for some time and
01:06
between all the travel in the us i like
01:08
to be home and and quiet so there's
01:10
going to be quite a few back and forth
01:11
this year how many flights how many
01:13
flights have you scheduled so far
01:16
uh i mean they changed every day we
01:18
covered you know you book one in the
01:20
next hour it's cancelled so you need to
01:21
go to the next one
01:23
and uh it's a bit of a challenge but uh
01:26
i mean you know it's good fun and uh i
01:28
guess i'll be quite used to jet lag at
01:30
the end of the year
01:32
so you know that you know that i worked
01:34
with a harvard um uh harvard sleep
01:36
trainer on jet lag during my
01:38
championship year and i don't know if
01:41
you've looked into something like that
01:42
but the secret was
01:44
to do small steps especially if you're
01:46
going like for a longer period so you
01:48
start at home one and a half hours per
01:50
day and then when you get there you
01:52
continue doing one and a half hours per
01:54
day this way you don't have any jet lag
01:55
at all i don't know maybe you can uh try
01:58
something like that as well yeah i did
02:00
try when when i was in formula one and
02:01
it actually works quite well when you go
02:03
to asia with the kids because you go to
02:05
bed early and earlier you know you end
02:06
up going to bed at seven and waking
02:08
about like five or four
02:09
but going to the us with their kids is
02:12
impossible because then i end up going
02:13
to bed at 1 am and the kids at 6 30 they
02:16
wake me up and i said daddy let's go
02:17
play so
02:18
i've given up
02:20
so most of the time you're taking the
02:22
family over there as well or something
02:24
no they stay here and uh this this
02:27
summer we will go there i think we will
02:29
have a big rv and we're gonna go on and
02:32
drive around the country and discover
02:33
something new that sounds awesome that's
02:36
a nice new step of life no
02:39
yeah exactly it's very different i found
02:41
the atmosphere there absolutely amazing
02:45
such a warm welcome and back to basics
02:49
and racing and that feels good that's
02:51
cool that's nice nice to hear i want to
02:54
jump to the beginning of your career
02:55
like where was the where did the dream
02:57
start for you to like be f1 driver
03:00
fighting for for big things where was
03:03
the beginning of the dream
03:04
it was all it was always my dad uh you
03:07
know he was he was always passionate
03:08
about racing cars and uh he started
03:12
competing himself when he was about 40
03:14
so i was what eight years old and uh
03:17
coming with him on the races and seeing
03:19
the cars and
03:21
then he bought himself a go-kart to
03:23
practice to to do some formula three in
03:25
the swiss championship
03:27
and uh he bought
03:29
he bought me one and i jumped in the
03:30
go-kart and then every wednesday
03:32
afternoon every saturday morning i was
03:33
at the track
03:35
and eventually asked to go racing and
03:37
that's how it all went and did you like
03:40
did you ever believe like yes i can do
03:42
this i could be a formula one driver or
03:44
did it like evolve like
03:46
what was your thinking
03:48
i know in old fairness i had no idea i
03:50
could make it until i was in formula two
03:52
uh just because you know you go card
03:54
with so many other races you know and
03:57
then you go
03:58
through the categories and then there's
03:59
only 20 seats at the top of the of the
04:01
ladder in formula one so you know it's
04:03
it's a very steep pyramid
04:05
and um
04:06
[Music]
04:07
what eventually when i when i made it to
04:09
do gp2 at the time uh and i started
04:12
winning races i thought oh you know what
04:14
maybe i can maybe i can make it but
04:16
beforehand it was just uh going racing
04:18
and having fun and so in gp2 you
04:20
actually thought yes i can do this i can
04:22
i can become a former one driver yeah in
04:24
gp2 i thought you know if i can win the
04:27
category just under formula one and and
04:30
compete with the the top guys here then
04:32
i think i have a chance so that's
04:34
already more than more the more
04:35
confidence that i ever had i was never
04:37
even in the last step i was i was not
04:40
convinced that i could race the likes of
04:42
shoemakers montoya's you know who were
04:44
racing in my time uh
04:46
i don't know i never had that big um big
04:48
self-confidence anyway so then you won
04:50
formula three gp2 but before before
04:53
winning gp2 of course you were renault
04:55
test driver 2009
04:57
and suddenly out of the blue
04:59
you get called up to get to jump into
05:01
the race seat
05:02
like with not so much practice and right
05:05
in against the toughest opponent in the
05:07
world at the time which was fernando
05:09
alonso in his absolute prime
05:11
can you take us through a little bit how
05:13
that like that moment was of finding out
05:15
okay i'm actually gonna get the race
05:16
seat next to alonso now and i'm not
05:17
really prepared and like was it just
05:19
exciting or was it like oh i don't
05:21
know if i'm gonna manage to do this so
05:22
well or what was the feelings i think i
05:24
think it was just excitement because if
05:26
i give you the background so yes i was i
05:28
was a honor test driver for a long time
05:31
even though the r29 i think was named in
05:34
2009 i never drove it until i got to
05:37
valencia free practice one never even
05:40
you know i made my seat and that was it
05:43
there were no simulator at the time so i
05:45
didn't practice anything um
05:47
and i was i was leading the gp2
05:50
and then i got the phone call after
05:52
germany you are in the car in hungary
05:55
next week so i'm all excited ready for
05:57
it you know it was it was pat simons
05:59
call me calling me
06:00
and then uh the next day i got a phone
06:02
call nothing got no actually nelson has
06:04
got the last chance he will do hungary
06:06
so i'm like oh okay i'm back to gp2 so
06:09
you know i mean it was great to be gp2
06:12
is amazing but when you have the call
06:13
that you're gonna be in the car
06:15
in the formula one and then they call
06:17
you back and say no you're not it was a
06:19
bit of a disappointment
06:20
and then eventually i get the cold again
06:22
uh before the summer break or during the
06:24
summer break okay in valencia are you in
06:26
the car
06:27
it is seven grand please to practice to
06:29
warm up no pressure no need of results
06:31
the car is anywhere not good uh just
06:34
take it as a as a learning curve and
06:36
2010 you're in the car uh with a you
06:39
know much better situation so for me
06:42
there was no real impression that where
06:44
that
06:45
it was seven grand priests to learn what
06:47
formula one is and
06:49
well didn't turn up to me that way
06:51
i'm surprised that you say there's no
06:53
pressure because for a young driver
06:55
you only have a handful of moments to
06:57
impress
06:58
and and to tell everybody okay you
07:00
deserve to be there so i'm surprised
07:01
that you were able to still keep it so
07:03
so light-hearted in a way so that's
07:05
that's a good mindset i think yeah i
07:06
think and you know obviously because
07:09
you're told it's it's like practice
07:10
because you never race the car obviously
07:12
going to the grid there were pressure on
07:13
you know when it's your first grandpa
07:15
you want to do well and so on but
07:17
if you if you take the old picture it
07:19
was like yeah you know it's it's a
07:21
practice for you we don't expect
07:22
anything from you uh we don't you know
07:25
no no pressure was the word
07:27
and uh and then the crash gate story
07:30
appeared i was i was managed by flavio
07:32
at the time
07:33
and uh you know when when everything was
07:36
was was happening they cleared the whole
07:38
house and i was clear with the furniture
07:41
yeah
07:42
you that crash gate cost me the win by
07:44
the way in singapore at the time
07:46
so
07:47
that was uh i also have a connection to
07:49
that um you're racing you're racing
07:51
alonzo then in those seven races
07:53
he was in his super prime he's one of
07:55
the best of all time do you remember any
07:57
like moments where like oh my god what
08:00
what is this guy doing like do you
08:02
remember some some crazy insane moments
08:05
one one in in suzuka and qualifying i
08:07
was they were weak and i was i was
08:09
faster than him in three practice and
08:12
comes qualifying the first set of tires
08:14
i'm faster than him
08:16
and then the second set of tar he kills
08:18
me and i'm like
08:20
damn you know what happened here and i
08:22
go and open the data and i remember
08:24
spoon corner you know we used to i don't
08:26
know we used to break a little bit for
08:27
the first part then lift off the break
08:29
and then breaking
08:30
i mean the first part he went in so fast
08:33
like instantly fast it wasn't the same
08:35
corner and i'm like who the hell did he
08:37
pull that off i mean he killed me like
08:39
three tenths in one corner that was it
08:41
you know i was three times behind how
08:42
did that happen
08:44
and what did you put it down to in the
08:45
end you do you think he was just
08:46
building up to it or is just those
08:48
special special abilities with
08:50
experience in the moments when it counts
08:53
having that said it you know having the
08:54
confidence the experience and and trying
08:57
something a bit you know crazy with the
09:00
card i was anyway the slowest but uh
09:02
trying to go for it and find out
09:04
something that was not written in the
09:06
book
09:07
and actually learn from that you know uh
09:09
and tried in the future as well to pull
09:12
some some outstanding performance
09:13
sometimes where you just feel confident
09:15
in the lap and you say okay i'm gonna
09:16
i'm gonna try it i had my own
09:18
experiences like that because i had
09:20
schumacher and hamilton is my teammate
09:22
so so you could imagine that i had the
09:24
occasional moment like that as well
09:25
along the way where it's just like it's
09:27
the same car and it's like how the hell
09:29
can they even physically humanly do
09:31
something like that in that moment it's
09:33
sometimes it's really big head
09:34
scratching
09:35
i'm sure they felt the same about you
09:37
some other time or about me
09:39
hopefully
09:41
hopefully um so then 2012 you you get
09:44
the call up to come back into formula
09:46
one which of course was a really cool
09:47
breakthrough for you to be in f1 two
09:49
years out then come back again that was
09:51
a big step with kimmy this time but it
09:54
started off to be a really tough tough
09:56
one for you i think the car was quite
09:57
good but you were crashing a lot is that
10:00
right that was the was that 2012 no
10:03
that's the perception from outside but
10:05
actually if you look at the races and so
10:06
on it's it's not
10:08
it's not right uh surprisingly i was my
10:11
third race i was on the podium you know
10:13
for a rookie that wasn't bad i was third
10:15
on the road on the grid in australia and
10:17
then pasteur
10:19
kind of pushed me off in the race
10:22
in malaysia i was raining it was my
10:24
mistake i spun
10:25
i wanted too much
10:27
and then
10:28
and then i was on the podium in canada i
10:30
finished second i was leading the the
10:32
european grandpa in valencia when the
10:34
alternator failed
10:36
uh
10:37
in monaco i was forced on a grid and and
10:40
michael tried to overtake me
10:43
through the left going on the starting
10:45
grid and that's never going to work
10:46
because the guard really come back to
10:48
the right and we touched
10:50
and there were a few touches and i don't
10:52
know why the reputation started there
10:54
and then there was staff from koshan
10:55
where i collided with with lewis
10:58
obviously in that race i could have done
10:59
much better but if we look at the
11:01
footages uh luis could have also
11:04
you know give me a little bit more room
11:06
or back up from the situation as he did
11:08
in 2000 when was it 2018 mexico is
11:11
sebastian vettel at the start
11:13
well you know uh he he backed off so
11:17
there were stickers put on my on my head
11:19
with with crashes but actually if we
11:21
look at all the incident and the races
11:23
and so on
11:24
there weren't that many
11:26
man you're a memory machine
11:28
like what what's up with that
11:30
can you remember every single race or
11:32
what i i've got an elephant memory for
11:35
some of the the stuff you know
11:37
especially but anyways even if you're
11:39
even if you're saying no it's not really
11:41
the truth but still the sticker was put
11:42
on your head that you're a mr mr
11:44
crushing all the time wasn't that tough
11:46
from you this external opinion that was
11:48
building up and the pressure from
11:49
outside wasn't that a tough moment in
11:51
your career yeah that was that was
11:53
probably one of the toughest you know uh
11:55
just because you've got that sticker put
11:57
you on on your on your head uh you've
11:59
already came to formula one once came
12:02
back tried to do the best you can
12:05
did it did a pretty good season you know
12:07
i was three four podiums in my first
12:08
year in formula one uh and then you've
12:11
got that sticker and then you need to
12:13
drive under your level just to avoid
12:16
anything else and then come back in 2013
12:18
and same thing initially i had to be
12:19
very careful and make sure that i would
12:21
clean that sticker from from my head and
12:25
that is that is tough work
12:27
wasn't that the moment also where you
12:28
started to work with a psychologist
12:31
yes correct that was about 2012 just so
12:34
i could you know i could understand um
12:37
what was happening and and as i say i've
12:39
made mistakes i'm not saying i didn't
12:41
make any mistakes but uh
12:43
um also i think the sticker was was
12:45
probably not not quite
12:47
accurate as such uh but yes i went i
12:50
went through that and and learned a lot
12:52
you know and uh i think what i wanted is
12:55
to win the race absolutely to the you
12:56
know from the first corner to to the
12:58
last one um because you know in formula
13:01
one that's you know if you're first at
13:03
the first corner life is is much easier
13:05
than if you are at the back
13:08
of course and and who um who convinced
13:10
you to take a psychologist it just came
13:11
from yourself or was it the team or
13:14
no it came it came from myself and uh i
13:17
met my psychologist once i met her
13:20
through an institute in in paris and we
13:22
only chatted like
13:23
five minutes
13:25
but i knew her and then i think that was
13:27
in june or something like that and then
13:29
in september after spa
13:31
i phoned her and i said okay well you
13:32
know i'm going to try to see what i can
13:34
fine-tune to make sure that i take the
13:36
right decision uh again in spa i was it
13:39
wasn't 100 million zero percent
13:41
the other but uh it was mainly me and i
13:43
say okay what can i do better to avoid
13:45
that that's
13:47
that situation
13:48
so we have that in common uh because i
13:50
was working with a psychologist in 2006
13:52
no 2007. so i worked very very intensely
13:55
throughout almost my entire career
13:57
every two days we did two hour sessions
14:00
um which was it was tougher than all the
14:02
physical training it was like absolutely
14:04
extreme
14:05
um so we have that in common but the
14:06
difference was that you actually spoke
14:08
about it which i think is very
14:09
courageous because in our world in f1
14:11
you're a bit of a loser if you uh if you
14:14
have a brain doctor helping you you know
14:16
a psychologist so that sucks a bit but
14:18
you were courageous enough always to
14:19
talk about which which i respect a lot
14:21
um
14:22
and what was your biggest uh what was
14:24
your biggest progress that you found in
14:26
in your work with a psychologist like
14:28
the biggest eye-opening moment or where
14:30
you can really see okay that that
14:31
definitely um had a positive change in
14:34
my life as a result of of that work
14:37
you know i think you
14:39
every time every year there are some
14:41
it's crazy we can always progress
14:44
another brain works you know
14:46
obviously i went through through some
14:48
tough moments in my career
14:50
not mentioning the 29th of november 2020
14:54
but also i became a father
14:57
a husband and that changed your life in
14:59
in many ways and you know sometimes you
15:01
just
15:02
you just need to add up to two different
15:04
situation uh for me 2013 i was doing a
15:09
an amazing season and without any curse
15:11
issue early in the year i think i could
15:13
have
15:13
become probably vice world champion
15:16
and and then 2014 my car was a piece of
15:19
rubber and
15:21
you know i was we were the slowest and
15:23
and you are ready to
15:25
win races you've done all your work and
15:27
then suddenly the tool you have in
15:29
between your hand is just not good and
15:31
uh that is tough and then you work on
15:33
that and
15:34
also i remember when i was leading the
15:36
race in 2013 in suzuka it was about the
15:39
first time i was properly leading the
15:40
race from lap one and i was thinking
15:42
don't crash don't crash because you know
15:44
all the tvs are watching you so don't
15:46
put it in the gravel
15:48
and uh after that i spoke to the
15:49
psychologist so this is you know this is
15:51
brand new i've never experienced
15:53
leading a formula one race as such so
15:56
we worked around that uh so you work
15:58
around the good moments but also around
16:00
the tough ones and what was one of those
16:02
toughest moments like you explained that
16:04
now like being scared that you're gonna
16:05
crash that obviously isn't very
16:07
beneficial to performing well uh those
16:09
kind of thoughts but is there any very
16:10
dark other dark moments where you say
16:12
like oh damn i was sitting at home and
16:14
and i i started to think that maybe i'm
16:16
just not good enough for for being a
16:18
formula one uh driver or is there any
16:20
like really really dark moments that you
16:21
had in that time
16:23
no i never really thought i wasn't good
16:25
enough to be in formula one but there
16:26
was some dark moment where you think
16:28
what why did i do that you know why
16:30
like to me two two in my career that i'm
16:33
really not proud of is japan 2012. uh
16:36
when i crashed to the start with uh with
16:38
mark webber and that was 100 my fault i
16:41
didn't even see him i was so focused on
16:43
trying to overtake the other car that i
16:44
didn't even see him
16:46
and then barcelona 2018 when i spun in
16:49
turn three and uh
16:51
and i wanted to just to swipe the car
16:53
back on track and and one from throttle
16:55
instead of jumping on a brake and you
16:57
know giving up the position but 2012
17:00
like with mark webber that was after a
17:01
string of other incidents already which
17:04
other people saw mostly as your as your
17:06
fault and and how do you then how did
17:08
you then work through that with your
17:10
psychologist this self-doubt that came
17:11
like why did i why am i making such
17:13
mistakes why why can't i do better than
17:15
that how do you how do you overcome that
17:17
well we you know we work through all the
17:19
steps and and
17:21
why is is this happening why you know uh
17:25
why didn't
17:26
in japan why he didn't i didn't even see
17:28
it i didn't i was so focused on i think
17:30
it was a sauber on my left who's kamui
17:32
kobayashi why was i so focused on not
17:35
losing the position and why didn't
17:38
didn't i accept to lose a position at
17:40
the time even if i could get him back
17:43
and and then obviously trying to survive
17:45
the criticism from other drivers you
17:47
know the journalists that's their job to
17:48
criticize your critics us you know they
17:51
they do all the time anyway uh so we're
17:54
used to it but when it comes from the
17:55
other drivers then it's a bit more
17:56
complicated and and it hurts more so
17:59
then i had to drive you know until korea
18:02
2013 every first lap i was driving under
18:05
my capacity under my capability just
18:08
because i wanted to avoid and i remember
18:10
before korea i had a chat with my
18:12
psychologist and she says no you can go
18:14
you can be you can be engaged in lap one
18:16
and say are you crazy i say you know
18:18
what i went through so yeah but i think
18:20
you're ready you know i think you can
18:21
you know you can do it and if you watch
18:23
on youtube that first lap in korea 2013
18:26
had a big fight with luis
18:29
and uh came out on top of it and we you
18:31
know and i was back to where i like to
18:33
be so that's cool so with the
18:34
psychologist you just risked ma
18:36
positioned yourself different on the
18:38
risk management and just
18:39
decided to
18:41
consciously take a little bit less risks
18:43
at all time to build back up to it was
18:45
that was really the the key out of it or
18:47
what yeah if we want to simplify it and
18:49
yes he was trying to to back up for some
18:51
time making sure that you know the
18:54
confidence would come back normally
18:56
and then eventually when
18:58
when we were ready just go for it
19:00
that sounds cool that sounds like really
19:02
smart uh a smart approach which not so
19:04
many other drivers i think would have
19:06
done in in that way so that's uh that
19:08
sounds great yeah i think it was you
19:10
know it was great and uh i'm still you
19:12
know i haven't stopped working with her
19:14
uh obviously
19:16
after the crash in bahrain there were
19:18
also some you know some different work
19:20
that we needed to do
19:21
uh just because you can't you can't be
19:24
so close from this without working on it
19:27
you know if i had been working i would
19:29
have had nightmares that would have i
19:31
don't even think if i could have jumped
19:32
back in a racing car
19:34
but um
19:35
but we worked through through through
19:37
that and through the process and through
19:39
everything
19:40
so
19:41
you know i think you always you always
19:43
become stronger and stronger and you
19:44
know you we i mean you and me we know
19:47
how to prepare physically for racing
19:49
cars you know we've done it for 20 years
19:51
but we still use a trainer right
19:54
so the brain is the same thing to me why
19:56
don't we use someone to train our brain
19:58
even though we know
20:00
you know and it's more complicated than
20:02
just doing biceps curls or pull-ups or
20:04
bench press to be fair
20:06
no it's not necessarily i think it's
20:08
it's a very similar approach to to get
20:10
the training right in the most efficient
20:11
way is also very complicated and and to
20:13
progress mentally it's similar and i can
20:16
only encourage everybody who's watching
20:18
or listening really take some time in
20:20
your life to educate yourself also about
20:22
the mental side learn there's so much
20:25
valuable information out there which is
20:27
so powerful for our lives i can really
20:29
recommend it it also had such a big
20:31
impact on on my life so we really um we
20:33
really share that um if it's okay i
20:35
would like to touch on the um on the on
20:37
the tough crash of course a bit later
20:40
just coming back again you were racing
20:41
kimmy of course in 2012 2013. quick
20:44
comparison kimmy alonso any ideas who
20:46
you'd say
20:47
you would put as the as the faster guy
20:50
ah
20:51
i think the faster would be would be
20:53
alonso over one lap
20:56
over a race distance kimi always would
20:59
find a solution to go fast whatever
21:01
would happen you would always go fast in
21:02
a race
21:03
and you sometimes didn't really know how
21:05
he was doing it or what no exactly uh
21:07
you know you would you would just he
21:09
would just drive and say yeah the car
21:10
was okay and you're like no the car was
21:12
not okay it was you know just doing
21:14
oversteering whatever
21:16
what was do you remember any really
21:18
funny moment with kimmy
21:20
well you know we were teammate for two
21:22
years and we we never really
21:24
spoke that much kimi was kimi um even
21:27
though
21:28
since he's got kids
21:29
for the further much better
21:31
but i remember in spa sitting spa i
21:34
think so we're in the truck and he came
21:37
to me comes to me and he says
21:38
congratulations on the son of your uh
21:40
the burst of your son
21:42
i was like i was shocked because you
21:44
know we never spoke and out of the blue
21:46
he knew i just had a baby so i was like
21:47
okay thank you kimmy but i didn't know
21:49
what to say
21:52
but since the birth of his children
21:54
though he's become a bit of a comedian
21:55
on instagram so i think he's uh he seems
21:57
to have changed then
21:59
yeah he's changed a lot and uh he's not
22:01
a great great guy i mean you know i
22:04
always love racing him on track because
22:05
you know
22:06
that he's always gonna
22:08
respect and give you the room and you
22:10
can have you know you you can go in
22:11
confidence fighting kimmy on track for
22:13
sure
22:14
uh and yeah since he's got kids it's
22:16
quite fun um let's go to some more some
22:19
more positive stuff like if you now look
22:21
back um the most
22:23
the best most beautiful moment in your
22:25
f1 career what would you what would you
22:27
put it what was it
22:30
you know it's difficult i didn't win a
22:32
race and i didn't win a championship so
22:34
it's easy when you win you know to to
22:36
pick uh not easy but you can pick that
22:38
one for me i had many podiums um
22:41
and then i had some some less good cars
22:43
but some good races you know that
22:45
question comes very often to me and i
22:47
can't really pick one moment up of my of
22:49
my career i've had i've had a lot of
22:51
good moments
22:53
my last podium you were there uh you
22:55
know in 2015 and that was obviously a
22:57
good moment we had the bailiffs in the
22:59
garage the team was the cow was was
23:01
taped to stay together
23:04
and here we are on the podium and uh
23:06
obviously some good races with haas as
23:08
well so um yeah plenty of good memories
23:11
but you you can definitely say that
23:12
you're going out of f1 now with a very
23:14
fulfilled uh fulfilled mindset of all
23:16
the things you've achieved right yeah
23:18
very much you know i obviously i i never
23:21
win a race i never uh i never i was
23:23
never world champion but uh
23:25
at the end
23:26
i've had the career that i you know even
23:29
better than i could have hoped at the
23:31
beginning um i've you know been there
23:33
ten years i've i've gone around the
23:36
questions
23:37
and i was watching winter testing and i
23:39
don't feel bad not being there you know
23:41
i think i've i've done my time uh i was
23:44
obviously if if you get a call from
23:46
mercedes or red bull of ferrari then you
23:48
know it's a competitive car so why you
23:50
want to jump back in but uh to be to be
23:53
back of the grid and not being able to
23:55
fight for wins and so on i think i've
23:56
done my time and you know i'm happy to
23:58
watch it i'm still a fan about it but
24:00
i've i'm okay with not being there
24:02
anymore
24:03
i'm not too sure about your uh mention
24:05
of ferrari there in that trilogy of
24:06
competitive cars but let's leave that
24:08
let's leave that aside
24:11
you have to put ferry as a competitive
24:13
car whatever you know even if they're
24:14
not just put it in there
24:16
i have that though that i always
24:18
watching f1 always somehow still
24:20
accompanies me with a little bit of
24:22
negativity that i'm thinking like oh
24:24
uh i i could be there it's strange
24:26
because i'm totally fulfilled as well
24:28
but it still has always a tiny negative
24:30
there when i'm watching but i think it's
24:32
always going to be always going to be
24:33
like that yeah i mean you know i i i i'm
24:37
lucky to race in something else and i
24:38
guess i'm i'm finding a lot of pleasure
24:41
in in racing something else so really
24:43
for me
24:44
f1 the chapter is kind of closed
24:47
if it's a if it's okay i would still
24:49
like to before we close it completely
24:50
just go of course into one of the one of
24:52
the most difficult uh moments for you
24:55
and i'd like to start with a comment of
24:57
yours
24:58
and your comment is 2017 or 2018 i never
25:02
liked it and i still don't like it
25:05
i think it was a very sad day for f1
25:08
when it came out
25:10
do you know what i'm talking about yes
25:12
the halo
25:13
yes this is a this is a comment of yours
25:15
about the halo
25:17
what uh what is your view now on that
25:19
well
25:20
jean-thought came to see me in bahrain
25:22
on my hospital bed
25:24
and he said you remember what you say
25:26
about the halo and they say jean there's
25:28
only the dumbass that don't change their
25:29
mind
25:31
i have changed my mind
25:33
okay that's reassuring
25:36
i'm very glad to hear that
25:38
um so if it's
25:39
if it's okay with you i of course we'd
25:41
like to touch a little bit on on your
25:43
crash as well i hope i hope that's okay
25:46
for you and the crash you i mean you
25:47
were 27 seconds in the blazing fire and
25:50
then it was 67 g of of impact um
25:54
do you remember i hope that it's okay
25:56
for you that just to to to revisit it a
25:59
little bit i can imagine it's not so
26:00
easy but um i think the the listeners
26:03
would also appreciate from
26:05
getting an insight into some of those
26:06
experiences um
26:08
do you remember if you were scared at
26:10
any point as it was happening or or
26:12
after when you were sitting in the in
26:14
the fire
26:15
no actually no i think the
26:18
the first thing is between the the touch
26:20
with kiviat and the impact there's only
26:22
like six tenths of a second so you don't
26:24
really get the time to realize you're
26:26
gonna
26:27
hit the quad rail at that speed and then
26:29
surprisingly the impact for me wasn't
26:32
that bad you know 67 g is a lot but i
26:35
didn't feel like it was it was bad so i
26:38
i ended my silbed i'm ready to jump out
26:40
of the car and then i'm stuck and then i
26:42
you know i thought well i'm gonna wait
26:44
and then
26:45
they're gonna come and help me you know
26:47
i didn't know if it was upside down it's
26:48
night races there's no light in the
26:50
cockpit so you don't see anything you
26:51
don't know where you are
26:53
and um and then i realized there's fire
26:55
so oh okay no i can't wait and then i
26:58
try to jump out and jump out and jump
26:59
out and i i realize i'm completely stuck
27:01
and
27:02
and i realize the situation is is not
27:04
good
27:06
and then at one point i thought that was
27:08
it that was my day you know it was that
27:10
was game over
27:11
and uh that's why i say i was to me i
27:15
was i don't know five ten seconds from
27:17
being death dead uh
27:19
and and eventually i thought about my
27:21
three kids and i said no
27:22
i can't i can't leave them without that
27:25
and that's all i find the energy the
27:27
last energy to
27:29
to manage to find a solution to jump out
27:31
of the car even though you know i i
27:33
could i could feel my hands with burning
27:35
you know normally when you you touch
27:36
something hot you would you touch it and
27:38
remove it but i would i would keep my
27:40
hands and straight into the fire because
27:42
that's the only
27:43
grip i had to jump out of the car
27:45
and my foot was stuck and i was pulling
27:48
so hard on my leg that even my ankle
27:50
could have stayed there i wouldn't care
27:51
you know i just wanted to be out of the
27:53
car
27:54
and um
27:55
eventually made it
27:58
and
27:58
that that moment where i was sliding and
28:00
i knew i was off that was you know kind
28:02
of the best moment of you know of my
28:04
life maybe just because i was going to
28:06
leave um
28:08
and uh then i was in shock obviously
28:10
then i was in shock from from what
28:12
happened and seeing the fire and so on
28:13
and seeing what i went through um but
28:16
also you know it teach me a lot about me
28:19
that um
28:20
i knew i never give up in my life and i
28:22
never gave up in in my hopes and dreams
28:24
and and
28:25
wish to win races and to compete but uh
28:28
this experience being in in such a
28:31
difficult situation uh and not giving up
28:34
on and you know putting all you have in
28:37
your head fighting as high as hard as
28:39
you can to to escape that fire um show
28:42
me how strong it can be in in tough
28:45
times
28:46
i get uh i get shivers uh
28:48
listening to that because i also
28:50
remember sitting in front of the tv um
28:52
watching and of course i can relate a
28:54
tiny bit because of knowing how it feels
28:57
to sit in that cockpit in that space
28:59
um
29:00
and but you didn't you didn't have any
29:02
fear even when you started even the
29:03
moment you realized your foot was stuck
29:05
you weren't you weren't scared no
29:07
no i was i was not scared um
29:10
you know at that time you can't you
29:11
don't have the time to be scared
29:13
uh and and as i said at one point i
29:16
almost accepted that
29:17
that was it you know i would
29:20
i would be dead um it's quite it's quite
29:22
a strange feeling and that's obviously
29:24
something i had to work on with my
29:25
psychologist because say how can you
29:28
kind of accept you know and people say
29:29
oh you see all your life and so on no i
29:31
didn't see any of that i see
29:33
i see peace
29:35
and
29:36
and like
29:37
the body that that kind of relax and and
29:41
it is it is a very strange feeling um i
29:44
don't i don't
29:45
wish anyone to try it because you know
29:48
it's it's not not something you want to
29:50
go
29:51
but
29:52
it makes you
29:54
100 times stronger a thousand times
29:56
stronger
29:57
and i i read that you even had time to
29:59
relate to nikki lauda in those tenths of
30:01
a second is that that's really true
30:03
yeah that's true it's it's
30:05
when i undo the seat belt i start jump
30:08
out i don't i cannot do it and then i
30:10
realize i'm on fire and then i thought
30:12
about niki lauda and i said no no you
30:14
know i don't know why it's the third one
30:16
of the first footage that came into my
30:17
mind was with nikki being stuck in his
30:19
car on fire and and leaving the same
30:22
situation
30:24
i wish i could i wish i could speak with
30:26
him about it you know
30:29
because he was such a character i mean
30:30
you've been working with nikki
30:33
and
30:34
you know he was he was yeah to me was he
30:38
was the best legend of formula one no he
30:40
was a very special person yeah
30:41
absolutely and he gave me so much as
30:43
well in my career you know so i'm i'm of
30:45
course very very grateful as well and
30:46
wait i just saw your helmet recently on
30:48
on the internet actually it was
30:49
incredibly burning how are how are your
30:51
hands doing now
30:52
well you know one is
30:54
the right
30:55
is good um
30:57
the left is a little bit less good
31:00
you know i i as i say i can almost live
31:03
normally
31:04
i can't i can't cope with cold uh i
31:07
cannot put sun for two years on it so i
31:10
need to put sun cream and gloves and so
31:11
on uh
31:13
it's painful 23 hours a day
31:16
uh i need to do rehab exercise every 10
31:18
minutes just to not lose mobility
31:21
so
31:21
it's not all pink it's not it's not nice
31:25
but i've got my two hands i can drive
31:27
car i can kill my kids i can
31:30
play with them and that's what matters
31:34
and um and how
31:36
how has this now has it changed you in
31:39
any way in in life having such a extreme
31:41
experience and knowing how vulnerable
31:44
life actually is do you catch yourself
31:46
now in life maybe spending that half
31:48
hour more with your kids when when you
31:50
would otherwise have done instagram or
31:53
is there any uh any change like that
31:55
yeah there's there's a beef on and after
31:57
29 11 20 you know for me that you can't
32:00
you can't go through an experience like
32:02
this and be the same
32:04
um so yes there's a there's a beef on an
32:06
after i know i enjoy life more more
32:08
small details as you say being with my
32:12
kids more
32:13
especially that this year with all the
32:15
travel sometimes i'm aware a little bit
32:17
longer and uh you know try just try to
32:22
we we take life for granted you know
32:25
exactly sometimes yeah
32:27
but it can go very quickly
32:29
and so you really you say there's really
32:31
a distinctive change in some moments of
32:33
your life now which as a result of that
32:36
yeah i even got myself my wife worried
32:38
at one point because i was after the
32:40
crash i was playing table tennis
32:42
and with my trainer in bahrain when i
32:44
was trying to come back for abu dhabi
32:46
and uh and we come back to to the room
32:49
and say who won i said i don't know we
32:51
didn't play for points she got worried
32:53
because i never played for not winning
32:55
and that happened
32:57
so now you just play for the enjoying
32:59
the moment in life yeah exactly
33:01
okay well that's powerful now that it's
33:03
really had such a such a lasting uh
33:06
lasting impact on than on on your life
33:08
in in that way yeah for sure it does
33:11
change everything and just the way also
33:13
the way i've seen on my racing and you
33:15
know i'm still doing it very
33:16
professionally and training and doing
33:18
things right but
33:20
also
33:21
i don't want to forget the fun of it
33:23
which which you know in professional
33:25
sport we tend to
33:26
um you say
33:28
you say in professional sport you tend
33:29
to forget the fun of it how to explain
33:31
that a little bit more detail than in
33:32
your f1 f1 career you say fun became
33:35
smaller and smaller and why yeah i think
33:38
so just because you know you've got the
33:40
pressure you need to perform um
33:43
and
33:44
you know at the end if you don't if you
33:46
don't win you don't have
33:48
that much fun that's what we do since
33:50
we're little you know and uh just
33:52
driving car is great but when you travel
33:55
21 grand prize around the world
33:57
get jet lag in every direction
34:00
and you go to the race and you know your
34:02
car is only capable of doing 16 or
34:04
something like that
34:05
even though driving
34:07
f1 car is absolutely outstanding
34:10
you get fun for one session or one run
34:12
in free practice one and then you come
34:14
back to the garage you see your three
34:15
second of the pace and then you know
34:17
it's gonna go
34:18
and the fun just kind of disappears
34:21
yeah no i can i can relate to that that
34:22
um but but of course i had the element
34:26
in the last couple of years of having a
34:28
fantastic car but even then the fun
34:30
becomes becomes smaller with time
34:32
because there's just so much else
34:34
happening so much so much expectation
34:36
and pressure and
34:37
and um and battles and politics and
34:40
everything which unfortunately um just
34:42
reduces that that fun element with time
34:46
now for sure it's you know you had the
34:48
best car but yeah you also had one of
34:50
the best teammates to beat and uh
34:52
at the end
34:54
there's almost no room for fun it's not
34:56
that we forget it is that there's almost
34:57
no room for it you know just because
34:59
every time you do something it has to be
35:02
for the performance uh
35:04
and to go for it and therefore
35:06
it
35:08
yeah the fun starts to go a little bit
35:10
away
35:10
yeah yeah um can i just i come back
35:13
again to the work you've done with your
35:14
psychologist now after the crash that
35:16
you had
35:17
last november um because i don't know if
35:19
maybe there's a few things that we can
35:21
pick out of course we haven't most of us
35:22
haven't had anywhere near as extreme
35:24
experiences but but maybe it's still
35:26
relatable for some some some big
35:28
failures we have in life or something
35:30
else can you pick out like one
35:32
particularly very interesting thing
35:34
piece of work that you did with a
35:35
psychologist to to work through that and
35:38
and to uh to not um have any negativity
35:41
from the crash to continue in your in
35:43
your life is there one particular point
35:46
well
35:48
i think you know every every experience
35:50
is is different and it's it's quite hard
35:52
to
35:53
relate uh something what i would say is
35:56
you know that life is life is beautiful
35:59
and worse living and and
36:03
you know most of the time there is a
36:04
solution and even though when i was in
36:06
the fire they could look like there was
36:08
no solution to to live
36:10
at the end there were one and i had to
36:12
dig deep
36:13
and and to fight for it but uh
36:16
at the end it worked so
36:18
i i'm not the type of guy that goes on
36:20
social media and gives you know uh live
36:22
uh lessons or stuff that we can see uh
36:26
sometimes um
36:27
and i think we all we're all different
36:29
in the way we we leave things and and
36:31
you know the way we learn things about
36:33
ourselves uh
36:35
but
36:36
you know i think one of the key in life
36:39
generally is to never give up
36:40
you know never give up on on your dream
36:43
on your wishes on what you're doing and
36:45
sometimes it just may
36:47
not look good or may look hard and not
36:50
be pretty but um
36:52
i mean
36:52
if you if you give up you never know
36:54
what the answer is going to be the the
36:56
positive really is that it changed my
36:57
life for the best just because i
36:59
realized that uh
37:01
clothes are worse from from not having
37:03
any more seconds so you know
37:05
it's almost like a second birthday uh
37:08
and every second is bonus so i guess
37:10
that's
37:11
but that's that's even more than the
37:13
psychologist myself i i realized that
37:16
and i need you know every morning i wake
37:18
up and i realize and i remind me myself
37:20
that i'm here and that is you know that
37:23
that is lucky to be here
37:24
um
37:25
so yeah life life is worth believing
37:29
that's really nice to hear but then at
37:31
the same time now you signed for
37:32
dalecoin racing in uh in uh indy cars so
37:36
are you then a little bit of a nut case
37:37
or what because uh you're coming from
37:39
this and you're going into a racing
37:41
that's even more dangerous because
37:42
you're racing on ovals where we know
37:44
unfortunately that the the risk is
37:46
higher um
37:48
i mean
37:58
you're comfortable now or after that was
38:00
it how was the feeling like before you
38:02
got back into the first time in the
38:03
racing car in del coin racing were you a
38:05
bit like i don't know if i'm gonna
38:07
be able to do this or
38:09
you know i was i was never worried for
38:11
testing um i
38:13
knew jumping back in the car because i
38:15
did it in bahrain i wanted to to sit in
38:17
the in the house
38:19
yeah thursday
38:21
yeah i think it was thursday um so five
38:23
days after the crash and i felt i didn't
38:25
feel any
38:26
anything strange anything unusual
38:30
i wasn't worried sitting in a car we you
38:32
know in in motorsport we accept the risk
38:34
this is
38:35
it's since we do go-karts you know i
38:37
broke my collarbone in go-karts and
38:40
and and we have had crashes and things
38:42
and we know it it's dangerous and and we
38:45
always try to make with the gpd and so
38:47
on we always try to make the the sport
38:49
safer from the bottom of the ladder
38:51
um
38:53
obviously there are things a little bit
38:54
different you mentioned overs i'm not
38:56
doing the the speed west so i'm not
38:58
doing texas no indy 500 which is one of
39:00
the biggest race in the world that
39:02
obviously i would like to have it on my
39:03
palmaris but uh
39:05
it's not so much for me it's more for my
39:07
my family and my kids and my wife not to
39:10
put them into the situation again
39:12
because you know when you drive at 400
39:13
kph and there's a crash it's a big one
39:15
most of the time we touch with the guys
39:17
they jump out okay
39:19
but for a moment you can you see the
39:21
crash and you don't know and i don't
39:22
want to put them through uh that that
39:25
face you know
39:26
the risk we accepted i mean
39:29
formula you cannot drive a car 330 kph
39:32
next to each other
39:34
fighting the limits driving through the
39:35
streets of monaco flat out
39:38
without knowing that there is the risk
39:40
is involved and you know we accept it we
39:42
measure it we're not crazy as you say we
39:45
uh
39:46
we
39:47
you know it is our life you know living
39:49
on the edge but knowing
39:52
which which side is the good side i
39:54
really respect also how you're showing
39:56
your vulnerability now in this moment
39:57
how you're saying hey i actually don't
39:59
know how it's going to be when i'll be
40:01
in the middle of the race start with
40:02
with 24 other cars going uh going flat
40:05
out in the racing car on a rolling race
40:07
start no which is
40:09
more crazy than the f1 race starts um so
40:11
i really appreciate that and at the same
40:13
time it's great to see the courage of
40:14
the courage that you're that you're
40:15
taking to just put you into that
40:17
situation and just go for it um
40:20
very very very strong
40:22
yeah i'm passionate about it i love
40:24
racing and you know even on my hospital
40:26
bed the first the first mission was
40:28
trying to be back in the car in abu
40:30
dhabi
40:31
and uh never really i thought about
40:34
quitting you know and a lot of people
40:36
would have understood if i said you know
40:37
i retired at the end of my career
40:39
it would have been almost normal
40:41
but we we are not normal you know we
40:45
we built to be champions we built to be
40:47
to be races to be competitors
40:50
and as long as you have that wish that
40:52
you want you are not done with what you
40:54
love doing then uh
40:57
you know it's hard to stop and as i say
40:58
formula one for me the chapter is it's
41:00
turned and
41:02
i'm happy with what i've done i don't
41:04
regret anything
41:05
but mother spot i am i don't feel like
41:07
i'm done with it and if i would stop now
41:09
i would feel always something a bit
41:12
you know not so positive
41:13
what is for you like the dream targets
41:16
one or two targets left in in
41:18
motorsports it would be winning uh
41:19
winning indycar championship of course
41:21
and yeah that would be nice uh le mans
41:24
24 hours endurance racing you know
41:26
sharing the cars with teammates uh
41:28
that's something that i
41:30
i did last year the mall 24s on esports
41:33
and
41:34
with my team and my teammates and we
41:36
crossed the finish line and we finished
41:38
fourth
41:39
and it was actually super special to
41:40
share that moment with with the guys
41:42
even though we weren't in the same room
41:44
but we were talking and chatting on
41:46
discord and it was a it was a special
41:48
moment and i thought that that day i
41:50
thought you know what i think i've had
41:53
enough of trying to be as fast as i can
41:55
on my own no i want to make sure that i
41:57
go fast with my team you know my
42:00
teammates my car goes fast and endurance
42:03
is definitely something that i want to
42:05
do yeah that's really nice i've heard so
42:07
much about that i'm from f1 drivers
42:09
going to indycar and saying it's uh to
42:10
to le mans saying it's such a refreshing
42:12
experience because in f1 it's so ego ego
42:16
focused and ego driven it's just you and
42:18
and on your own against the others
42:20
feeling wise even though you have a team
42:23
um and that's really refreshing to share
42:25
the the resp the responsibility with
42:27
other drivers like that as you were
42:28
saying sounds really uh sounds like a
42:30
really nice environment
42:32
yeah no for sure it's definitely
42:33
something i want to try and you know
42:35
indycar has got
42:36
it's got a very different mentality as
42:38
well from from formula one it's a single
42:40
seater but there's such a
42:42
i mean everything is open you
42:44
i went to the first test of the season
42:46
and the car was being set up on the
42:49
on the parking
42:50
but our car next to a rail racing team
42:53
next to penske
42:55
and there's no tents no bugs no hiding
42:58
and they're like no i mean they're all
42:59
the same cars best the best one does the
43:02
best job on track and that's it and you
43:04
share barbecue in the evening with the
43:06
drivers and then obviously in the
43:07
morning you put your race helmet and
43:09
then it's it's fighting and beating them
43:11
all but the atmosphere is is so
43:13
different that it's already
43:15
something that uh you know coming from
43:17
ten years in formula one it's a big
43:19
change
43:20
that's so nice to hear i think it sounds
43:22
like you're gonna have a really nice
43:23
time and and with the talent that you
43:24
have i mean you have the best chances to
43:26
win the championship also the next in
43:28
the next couple of years so
43:29
at this point thank you so much for uh
43:31

43:33
think everybody who's listening as well
43:34
