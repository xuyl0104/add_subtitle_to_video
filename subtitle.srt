16
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,040

it and remove it but i would i would

18
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,040
keep my hands straight into the fire

19
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,040
because that's the only

20
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,040
grip i had to jump out of the car

21
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,040
my foot was stuck and i was pulling so

22
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,040
hard on my leg that even my ankle could

23
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,040
have stayed there i wouldn't care you

24
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,040
know i just wanted to be out of the car

25
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,040
at one point i thought that was it that

26
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,040
was my day you know

27
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,040
that was game over

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,040
hi roman thank you so much for taking

29
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,040
the time for a chat where are we finding

30
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,040
you

31
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,040
hey hey hi i'm you know i'm i'm good i'm

32
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,040
i'm back in switzerland where i uh i

33
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,040
live with the family for some time and

34
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,040
between all the travel in the us i like

35
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,040
to be home and and quiet so there's

36
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,040
going to be quite a few back and forth

37
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,040
this year how many flights how many

38
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,040
flights have you scheduled so far

39
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,040
uh i mean they changed every day we

40
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,040
covered you know you book one in the

41
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,040
next hour it's cancelled so you need to

42
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,040
go to the next one

43
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,040
and uh it's a bit of a challenge but uh

44
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,040
i mean you know it's good fun and uh i

45
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,040
guess i'll be quite used to jet lag at

46
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,040
the end of the year

47
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,040
so you know that you know that i worked

48
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,040
with a harvard um uh harvard sleep

49
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,040
trainer on jet lag during my

50
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:41,040
championship year and i don't know if

51
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,040
you've looked into something like that

52
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:44,040
but the secret was

53
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,040
to do small steps especially if you're

54
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,040
going like for a longer period so you

55
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,040
start at home one and a half hours per

56
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,040
day and then when you get there you

57
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,040
continue doing one and a half hours per

58
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,040
day this way you don't have any jet lag

59
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,040
at all i don't know maybe you can uh try

60
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,040
something like that as well yeah i did

61
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,040
try when when i was in formula one and

62
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,040
it actually works quite well when you go

63
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,040
to asia with the kids because you go to

64
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,040
bed early and earlier you know you end

65
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,040
up going to bed at seven and waking

66
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,040
about like five or four

67
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,040
but going to the us with their kids is

68
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,040
impossible because then i end up going

69
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,040
to bed at 1 am and the kids at 6 30 they

70
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,040
wake me up and i said daddy let's go

71
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,040
play so

72
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,040
i've given up

73
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,040
so most of the time you're taking the

74
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,040
family over there as well or something

75
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,040
no they stay here and uh this this

76
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,040
summer we will go there i think we will

77
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,040
have a big rv and we're gonna go on and

78
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,040
drive around the country and discover

79
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,040
something new that sounds awesome that's

80
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,040
a nice new step of life no

81
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,040
yeah exactly it's very different i found

82
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,040
the atmosphere there absolutely amazing

83
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,040
such a warm welcome and back to basics

84
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,040
and racing and that feels good that's

85
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,040
cool that's nice nice to hear i want to

86
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,040
jump to the beginning of your career

87
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,040
like where was the where did the dream

88
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,040
start for you to like be f1 driver

89
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,040
fighting for for big things where was

90
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,040
the beginning of the dream

91
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:07,040
it was all it was always my dad uh you

92
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,040
know he was he was always passionate

93
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,040
about racing cars and uh he started

94
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,040
competing himself when he was about 40

95
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,040
so i was what eight years old and uh

96
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,040
coming with him on the races and seeing

97
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,040
the cars and

98
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:23,040
then he bought himself a go-kart to

99
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,040
practice to to do some formula three in

100
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,040
the swiss championship

101
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,040
and uh he bought

102
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,040
he bought me one and i jumped in the

103
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,040
go-kart and then every wednesday

104
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,040
afternoon every saturday morning i was

105
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,040
at the track

106
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,040
and eventually asked to go racing and

107
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,040
that's how it all went and did you like

108
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,040
did you ever believe like yes i can do

109
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,040
this i could be a formula one driver or

110
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,040
did it like evolve like

111
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,040
what was your thinking

112
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,040
i know in old fairness i had no idea i

113
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,040
could make it until i was in formula two

114
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,040
uh just because you know you go card

115
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,040
with so many other races you know and

116
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,040
then you go

117
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,040
through the categories and then there's

118
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,040
only 20 seats at the top of the of the

119
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,040
ladder in formula one so you know it's

120
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:05,040
it's a very steep pyramid

121
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:06,040
and um

122
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,040
[Music]

123
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,040
what eventually when i when i made it to

124
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,040
do gp2 at the time uh and i started

125
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,040
winning races i thought oh you know what

126
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,040
maybe i can maybe i can make it but

127
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,040
beforehand it was just uh going racing

128
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,040
and having fun and so in gp2 you

129
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:22,040
actually thought yes i can do this i can

130
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,040
i can become a former one driver yeah in

131
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,040
gp2 i thought you know if i can win the

132
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,040
category just under formula one and and

133
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,040
compete with the the top guys here then

134
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,040
i think i have a chance so that's

135
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,040
already more than more the more

136
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,040
confidence that i ever had i was never

137
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,040
even in the last step i was i was not

138
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,040
convinced that i could race the likes of

139
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,040
shoemakers montoya's you know who were

140
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,040
racing in my time uh

141
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,040
i don't know i never had that big um big

142
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,040
self-confidence anyway so then you won

143
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,040
formula three gp2 but before before

144
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,040
winning gp2 of course you were renault

145
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,040
test driver 2009

146
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,040
and suddenly out of the blue

147
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,040
you get called up to get to jump into

148
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,040
the race seat

149
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,040
like with not so much practice and right

150
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,040
in against the toughest opponent in the

151
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,040
world at the time which was fernando

152
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,040
alonso in his absolute prime

153
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,040
can you take us through a little bit how

154
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,040
that like that moment was of finding out

155
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,040
okay i'm actually gonna get the race

156
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,040
seat next to alonso now and i'm not

157
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,040
really prepared and like was it just

158
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,040
exciting or was it like oh i don't

159
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,040
know if i'm gonna manage to do this so

160
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,040
well or what was the feelings i think i

161
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,040
think it was just excitement because if

162
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,040
i give you the background so yes i was i

163
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,040
was a honor test driver for a long time

164
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,040
even though the r29 i think was named in

165
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,040
2009 i never drove it until i got to

166
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,040
valencia free practice one never even

167
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,040
you know i made my seat and that was it

168
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,040
there were no simulator at the time so i

169
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,040

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,040
you back and say no you're not it was a

185
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,040
bit of a disappointment

186
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,040
and then eventually i get the cold again

187
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:24,040
uh before the summer break or during the

188
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,040
summer break okay in valencia are you in

189
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,040
the car

190
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,040
it is seven grand please to practice to

191
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,040
warm up no pressure no need of results

192
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,040
the car is anywhere not good uh just

193
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,040
take it as a as a learning curve and

194
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,040
2010 you're in the car uh with a you

195
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,040
know much better situation so for me

196
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,040
there was no real impression that where

197
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,040
that

198
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,040
it was seven grand priests to learn what

199
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,040
formula one is and

200
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,040
well didn't turn up to me that way

201
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,040
i'm surprised that you say there's no

202
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,040
pressure because for a young driver

203
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,040
you only have a handful of moments to

204
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,040
impress

205
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,040
and and to tell everybody okay you

206
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,040
deserve to be there so i'm surprised

207
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,040
that you were able to still keep it so

208
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,040
so light-hearted in a way so that's

209
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,040
that's a good mindset i think yeah i

210
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,040
think and you know obviously because

211
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,040
you're told it's it's like practice

212
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,040
because you never race the car obviously

213
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,040
going to the grid there were pressure on

214
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,040
you know when it's your first grandpa

215
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,040
you want to do well and so on but

216
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:19,040
if you if you take the old picture it

217
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,040
was like yeah you know it's it's a

218
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,040
practice for you we don't expect

219
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,040
anything from you uh we don't you know

220
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,040
no no pressure was the word

221
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,040
and uh and then the crash gate story

222
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,040
appeared i was i was managed by flavio

223
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,040
at the time

224
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,040
and uh you know when when everything was

225
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,040
was was happening they cleared the whole

226
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,040
house and i was clear with the furniture

227
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,040
yeah

228
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,040
you that crash gate cost me the win by

229
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,040
the way in singapore at the time

230
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,040
so

231
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,040
that was uh i also have a connection to

232
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,040
that um you're racing you're racing

233
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,040
alonzo then in those seven races

234
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,040
he was in his super prime he's one of

235
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,040
the best of all time do you remember any

236
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,040
like moments where like oh my god what

237
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,040
what is this guy doing like do you

238
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,040
remember some some crazy insane moments

239
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,040
one one in in suzuka and qualifying i

240
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,040
was they were weak and i was i was

241
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,040
faster than him in three practice and

242
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,040
comes qualifying the first set of tires

243
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,040
i'm faster than him

244
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,040
and then the second set of tar he kills

245
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,040
me and i'm like

246
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,040
damn you know what happened here and i

247
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,040
go and open the data and i remember

248
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,040
spoon corner you know we used to i don't

249
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,040
know we used to break a little bit for

250
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,040
the first part then lift off the break

251
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,040
and then breaking

252
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,040
i mean the first part he went in so fast

253
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,040
like instantly fast it wasn't the same

254
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,040
corner and i'm like who the hell did he

255
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,040
pull that off i mean he killed me like

256
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,040
three tenths in one corner that was it

257
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,040
you know i was three times behind how

258
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,040
did that happen

259
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,040
and what did you put it down to in the

260
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,040
end you do you think he was just

261
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,040
building up to it or is just those

262
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,040
special special abilities with

263
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,040
experience in the moments when it counts

264
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,040
having that said it you know having the

265
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,040
confidence the experience and and trying

266
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,040
something a bit you know crazy with the

267
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,040
card i was anyway the slowest but uh

268
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,040
trying to go for it and find out

269
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,040
something that was not written in the

270
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,040
book

271
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,040
and actually learn from that you know uh

272
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,040
and tried in the future as well to pull

273
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,040
some some outstanding performance

274
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,040
sometimes where you just feel confident

275
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,040
in the lap and you say okay i'm gonna

276
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,040
i'm gonna try it i had my own

277
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,040
experiences like that because i had

278
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,040
schumacher and hamilton is my teammate

279
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,040
so so you could imagine that i had the

280
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,040
occasional moment like that as well

281
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,040
along the way where it's just like it's

282
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,040
the same car and it's like how the hell

283
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,040
can they even physically humanly do

284
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,040
something like that in that moment it's

285
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,040
sometimes it's really big head

286
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,040
scratching

287
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,040
i'm sure they felt the same about you

288
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,040
some other time or about me

289
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,040
hopefully

290
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,040
hopefully um so then 2012 you you get

291
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,040
the call up to come back into formula

292
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,040
one which of course was a really cool

293
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,040
breakthrough for you to be in f1 two

294
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,040
years out then come back again that was

295
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,040
a big step with kimmy this time but it

296
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,040
started off to be a really tough tough

297
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,040
one for you i think the car was quite

298
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,040
good but you were crashing a lot is that

299
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,040
right that was the was that 2012 no

300
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,040
that's the perception from outside but

301
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,040
actually if you look at the races and so

302
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,040
on it's it's not

303
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,040
it's not right uh surprisingly i was my

304
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,040
third race i was on the podium you know

305
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,040
for a rookie that wasn't bad i was third

306
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,040
on the road on the grid in australia and

307
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,040
then pasteur

308
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,040
kind of pushed me off in the race

309
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,040
in malaysia i was raining it was my

310
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,040
mistake i spun

311
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,040
i wanted too much

312
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,040
and then

313
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,040
and then i was on the podium in canada i

314
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,040
finished second i was leading the the

315
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,040
european grandpa in valencia when the

316
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,040
alternator failed

317
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:37,040
uh

318
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,040
in monaco i was forced on a grid and and

319
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,040
michael tried to overtake me

320
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,040
through the left going on the starting

321
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,040
grid and that's never going to work

322
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,040
because the guard really come back to

323
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,040
the right and we touched

324
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,040
and there were a few touches and i don't

325
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,040
know why the reputation started there

326
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,040
and then there was staff from koshan

327
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,040
where i collided with with lewis

328
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,040
obviously in that race i could have done

329
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,040
much better but if we look at the

330
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,040
footages uh luis could have also

331
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,040
you know give me a little bit more room

332
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,040
or back up from the situation as he did

333
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,040
in 2000 when was it 2018 mexico is

334
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:13,040
sebastian vettel at the start

335
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:17,040
well you know uh he he backed off so

336
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,040
there were stickers put on my on my head

337
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,040
with with crashes but actually if we

338
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,040
look at all the incident and the races

339
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,040
and so on

340
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,040
there weren't that many

341
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,040
man you're a memory machine

342
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,040
like what what's up with that

343
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,040
can you remember every single race or

344
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,040
what i i've got an elephant memory for

345
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,040
some of the the stuff you know

346
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,040
especially but anyways even if you're

347
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,040
even if you're saying no it's not really

348
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,040
the truth but still the sticker was put

349
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,040
on your head that you're a mr mr

350
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,040
crushing all the time wasn't that tough

351
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,040
from you this external opinion that was

352
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,040
building up and the pressure from

353
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,040
outside wasn't that a tough moment in

354
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,040
your career yeah that was that was

355
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,040
probably one of the toughest you know uh

356
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,040
just because you've got that sticker put

357
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,040
you on on your on your head uh you've

358
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,040
already came to formula one once came

359
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,040
back tried to do the best you can

360
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,040
did it did a pretty good season you know

361
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,040
i was three four podiums in my first

362
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,040
year in formula one uh and then you've

363
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,040
got that sticker and then you need to

364
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,040
drive under your level just to avoid

365
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:18,040
anything else and then come back in 2013

366
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,040
and same thing initially i had to be

367
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,040
very careful and make sure that i would

368
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,040
clean that sticker from from my head and

369
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,040
that is that is tough work

370
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,040
wasn't that the moment also where you

371
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,040
started to work with a psychologist

372
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,040
yes correct that was about 2012 just so

373
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,040
i could you know i could understand um

374
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,040
what was happening and and as i say i've

375
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,040
made mistakes i'm not saying i didn't

376
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,040
make any mistakes but uh

377
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,040
um also i think the sticker was was

378
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,040
probably not not quite

379
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,040
accurate as such uh but yes i went i

380
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,040
went through that and and learned a lot

381
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,040
you know and uh i think what i wanted is

382
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,040
to win the race absolutely to the you

383
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,040
know from the first corner to to the

384
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:01,040
last one um because you know in formula

385
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,040
one that's you know if you're first at

386
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,040
the first corner life is is much easier

387
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,040
than if you are at the back

388
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,040
of course and and who um who convinced

389
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,040
you to take a psychologist it just came

390
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,040
from yourself or was it the team or

391
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,040
no it came it came from myself and uh i

392
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,040
met my psychologist once i met her

393
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,040
through an institute in in paris and we

394
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,040
only chatted like

395
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,040
five minutes

396
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,040
but i knew her and then i think that was

397
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,040
in june or something like that and then

398
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,040
in september after spa

399
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,040
i phoned her and i said okay well you

400
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,040
know i'm going to try to see what i can

401
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,040
fine-tune to make sure that i take the

402
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,040
right decision uh again in spa i was it

403
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:41,040
wasn't 100 million zero percent

404
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,040
the other but uh it was mainly me and i

405
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,040
say okay what can i do better to avoid

406
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,040
that that's

407
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,040
that situation

408
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,040
so we have that in common uh because i

409
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,040
was working with a psychologist in 2006

410
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,040
no 2007. so i worked very very intensely

411
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,040
throughout almost my entire career

412
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,040
every two days we did two hour sessions

413
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,040
um which was it was tougher than all the

414
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,040
physical training it was like absolutely

415
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,040
extreme

416
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,040
um so we have that in common but the

417
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,040
difference was that you actually spoke

418
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,040
about it which i think is very

419
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,040
courageous because in our world in f1

420
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,040
you're a bit of a loser if you uh if you

421
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,040
have a brain doctor helping you you know

422
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,040
a psychologist so that sucks a bit but

423
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:19,040
you were courageous enough always to

424
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,040
talk about which which i respect a lot

425
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,040
um

426
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:24,040
and what was your biggest uh what was

427
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,040
your biggest progress that you found in

428
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,040
in your work with a psychologist like

429
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,040
the biggest eye-opening moment or where

430
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,040
you can really see okay that that

431
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,040
definitely um had a positive change in

432
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,040
my life as a result of of that work

433
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,040
you know i think you

434
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,040
every time every year there are some

435
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,040
it's crazy we can always progress

436
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,040
another brain works you know

437
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,040
obviously i went through through some

438
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,040
tough moments in my career

439
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,040
not mentioning the 29th of november 2020

440
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:57,040
but also i became a father

441
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,040
a husband and that changed your life in

442
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,040
in many ways and you know sometimes you

443
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,040
just

444
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,040
you just need to add up to two different

445
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,040
situation uh for me 2013 i was doing a

446
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,040
an amazing season and without any curse

447
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,040
issue early in the year i think i could

448
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,040
have

449
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,040
become probably vice world champion

450
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,040
and and then 2014 my car was a piece of

451
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,040
rubber and

452
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,040
you know i was we were the slowest and

453
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,040
and you are ready to

454
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,040
win races you've done all your work and

455
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,040
then suddenly the tool you have in

456
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,040
between your hand is just not good and

457
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,040
uh that is tough and then you work on

458
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,040
that and

459
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,040
also i remember when i was leading the

460
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,040
race in 2013 in suzuka it was about the

461
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:40,040
first time i was properly leading the

462
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,040
race from lap one and i was thinking

463
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,040
don't crash don't crash because you know

464
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,040
all the tvs are watching you so don't

465
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,040
put it in the gravel

466
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,040
and uh after that i spoke to the

467
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,040
psychologist so this is you know this is

468
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,040
brand new i've never experienced

469
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,040
leading a formula one race as such so

470
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,040
we worked around that uh so you work

471
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,040
around the good moments but also around

472
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,040
the tough ones and what was one of those

473
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,040
toughest moments like you explained that

474
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,040
now like being scared that you're gonna

475
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,040
crash that obviously isn't very

476
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,040
beneficial to performing well uh those

477
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,040
kind of thoughts but is there any very

478
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,040
dark other dark moments where you say

479
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,040
like oh damn i was sitting at home and

480
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,040
and i i started to think that maybe i'm

481
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,040
just not good enough for for being a

482
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,040
formula one uh driver or is there any

483
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,040
like really really dark moments that you

484
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:23,040
had in that time

485
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,040
no i never really thought i wasn't good

486
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,040
enough to be in formula one but there

487
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,040
was some dark moment where you think

488
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,040
what why did i do that you know why

489
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,040
like to me two two in my career that i'm

490
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,040
really not proud of is japan 2012. uh

491
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,040
when i crashed to the start with uh with

492
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,040
mark webber and that was 100 my fault i

493
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,040
didn't even see him i was so focused on

494
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,040
trying to overtake the other car that i

495
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,040
didn't even see him

496
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,040
and then barcelona 2018 when i spun in

497
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,040
turn three and uh

498
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,040
and i wanted to just to swipe the car

499
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,040
back on track and and one from throttle

500
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,040
instead of jumping on a brake and you

501
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,040
know giving up the position but 2012

502
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,040
like with mark webber that was after a

503
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,040
string of other incidents already which

504
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,040
other people saw mostly as your as your

505
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,040
fault and and how do you then how did

506
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,040
you then work through that with your

507
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,040
psychologist this self-doubt that came

508
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,040
like why did i why am i making such

509
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,040
mistakes why why can't i do better than

510
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,040
that how do you how do you overcome that

511
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,040
well we you know we work through all the

512
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,040
steps and and

513
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,040
why is is this happening why you know uh

514
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,040
why didn't

515
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,040
in japan why he didn't i didn't even see

516
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,040
it i didn't i was so focused on i think

517
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,040
it was a sauber on my left who's kamui

518
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,040
kobayashi why was i so focused on not

519
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,040
losing the position and why didn't

520
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,040
didn't i accept to lose a position at

521
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,040
the time even if i could get him back

522
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:45,040
and and then obviously trying to survive

523
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,040
the criticism from other drivers you

524
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,040
know the journalists that's their job to

525
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,040
criticize your critics us you know they

526
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,040
they do all the time anyway uh so we're

527
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,040
used to it but when it comes from the

528
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,040
other drivers then it's a bit more

529
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:59,040
complicated and and it hurts more so

530
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,040
then i had to drive you know until korea

531
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,040
2013 every first lap i was driving under

532
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,040
my capacity under my capability just

533
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:10,040
because i wanted to avoid and i remember

534
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,040
before korea i had a chat with my

535
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,040
psychologist and she says no you can go

536
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,040
you can be you can be engaged in lap one

537
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,040
and say are you crazy i say you know

538
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,040
what i went through so yeah but i think

539
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,040
you're ready you know i think you can

540
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,040
you know you can do it and if you watch

541
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:26,040
on youtube that first lap in korea 2013

542
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:29,040
had a big fight with luis

543
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,040
and uh came out on top of it and we you

544
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,040
know and i was back to where i like to

545
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,040
be so that's cool so with the

546
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,040
psychologist you just risked ma

547
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:38,040
positioned yourself different on the

548
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,040
risk management and just

549
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,040
decided to

550
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:43,040
consciously take a little bit less risks

551
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,040
at all time to build back up to it was

552
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,040
that was really the the key out of it or

553
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:49,040
what yeah if we want to simplify it and

554
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,040
yes he was trying to to back up for some

555
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:54,040
time making sure that you know the

556
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,040
confidence would come back normally

557
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,040
and then eventually when

558
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,040
when we were ready just go for it

559
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,040
that sounds cool that sounds like really

560
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,040
smart uh a smart approach which not so

561
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,040
many other drivers i think would have

562
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,040
done in in that way so that's uh that

563
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,040
sounds great yeah i think it was you

564
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,040
know it was great and uh i'm still you

565
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,040
know i haven't stopped working with her

566
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:16,040
uh obviously

567
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:18,040
after the crash in bahrain there were

568
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,040
also some you know some different work

569
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,040
that we needed to do

570
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,040
uh just because you can't you can't be

571
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,040
so close from this without working on it

572
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,040
you know if i had been working i would

573
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,040
have had nightmares that would have i

574
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,040
don't even think if i could have jumped

575
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,040
back in a racing car

576
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,040
but um

577
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,040
but we worked through through through

578
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,040
that and through the process and through

579
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,040
everything

580
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,040
so

581
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,040
you know i think you always you always

582
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,040
become stronger and stronger and you

583
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,040
know you we i mean you and me we know

584
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,040
how to prepare physically for racing

585
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:51,040
cars you know we've done it for 20 years

586
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,040
but we still use a trainer right

587
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:56,040
so the brain is the same thing to me why

588
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,040
don't we use someone to train our brain

589
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,040
even though we know

590
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,040
you know and it's more complicated than

591
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,040
just doing biceps curls or pull-ups or

592
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,040
bench press to be fair

593
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,040
no it's not necessarily i think it's

594
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,040
it's a very similar approach to to get

595
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,040
the training right in the most efficient

596
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:13,040
way is also very complicated and and to

597
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,040
progress mentally it's similar and i can

598
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,040
only encourage everybody who's watching

599
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,040
or listening really take some time in

600
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,040
your life to educate yourself also about

601
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,040
the mental side learn there's so much

602
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,040
valuable information out there which is

603
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,040
so powerful for our lives i can really

604
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,040
recommend it it also had such a big

605
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,040
impact on on my life so we really um we

606
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,040
really share that um if it's okay i

607
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,040
would like to touch on the um on the on

608
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,040
the tough crash of course a bit later

609
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:41,040
just coming back again you were racing

610
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,040
kimmy of course in 2012 2013. quick

611
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,040
comparison kimmy alonso any ideas who

612
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,040
you'd say

613
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,040
you would put as the as the faster guy

614
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:51,040
ah

615
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,040
i think the faster would be would be

616
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,040
alonso over one lap

617
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,040
over a race distance kimi always would

618
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,040
find a solution to go fast whatever

619
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,040
would happen you would always go fast in

620
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,040
a race

621
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,040
and you sometimes didn't really know how

622
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,040
he was doing it or what no exactly uh

623
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,040
you know you would you would just he

624
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,040
would just drive and say yeah the car

625
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,040
was okay and you're like no the car was

626
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,040
not okay it was you know just doing

627
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,040
oversteering whatever

628
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,040
what was do you remember any really

629
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,040
funny moment with kimmy

630
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,040
well you know we were teammate for two

631
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,040
years and we we never really

632
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,040
spoke that much kimi was kimi um even

633
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,040
though

634
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,040
since he's got kids

635
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,040
for the further much better

636
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:34,040
but i remember in spa sitting spa i

637
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,040
think so we're in the truck and he came

638
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,040
to me comes to me and he says

639
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,040
congratulations on the son of your uh

640
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,040
the burst of your son

641
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,040
i was like i was shocked because you

642
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,040
know we never spoke and out of the blue

643
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,040
he knew i just had a baby so i was like

644
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,040
okay thank you kimmy but i didn't know

645
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,040
what to say

646
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,040
but since the birth of his children

647
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,040
though he's become a bit of a comedian

648
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,040
on instagram so i think he's uh he seems

649
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,040
to have changed then

650
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,040
yeah he's changed a lot and uh he's not

651
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:04,040
a great great guy i mean you know i

652
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,040
always love racing him on track because

653
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,040
you know

654
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,040
that he's always gonna

655
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,040
respect and give you the room and you

656
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,040
can have you know you you can go in

657
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:13,040
confidence fighting kimmy on track for

658
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,040
sure

659
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,040
uh and yeah since he's got kids it's

660
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,040
quite fun um let's go to some more some

661
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,040
more positive stuff like if you now look

662
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,040
back um the most

663
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,040
the best most beautiful moment in your

664
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,040
f1 career what would you what would you

665
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:30,040
put it what was it

666
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:32,040
you know it's difficult i didn't win a

667
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,040
race and i didn't win a championship so

668
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,040
it's easy when you win you know to to

669
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,040
pick uh not easy but you can pick that

670
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,040
one for me i had many podiums um

671
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,040
and then i had some some less good cars

672
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,040
but some good races you know that

673
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,040
question comes very often to me and i

674
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,040
can't really pick one moment up of my of

675
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:51,040
my career i've had i've had a lot of

676
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,040
good moments

677
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,040
my last podium you were there uh you

678
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,040
know in 2015 and that was obviously a

679
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,040
good moment we had the bailiffs in the

680
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,040
garage the team was the cow was was

681
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,040
taped to stay together

682
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,040
and here we are on the podium and uh

683
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,040
obviously some good races with haas as

684
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:11,040
well so um yeah plenty of good memories

685
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,040
but you you can definitely say that

686
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,040
you're going out of f1 now with a very

687
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,040
fulfilled uh fulfilled mindset of all

688
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:18,040
the things you've achieved right yeah

689
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,040
very much you know i obviously i i never

690
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,040
win a race i never uh i never i was

691
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,040
never world champion but uh

692
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,040
at the end

693
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:29,040
i've had the career that i you know even

694
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,040
better than i could have hoped at the

695
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,040
beginning um i've you know been there

696
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,040
ten years i've i've gone around the

697
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,040
questions

698
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,040
and i was watching winter testing and i

699
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,040
don't feel bad not being there you know

700
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:44,040
i think i've i've done my time uh i was

701
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:46,040
obviously if if you get a call from

702
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,040
mercedes or red bull of ferrari then you

703
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,040
know it's a competitive car so why you

704
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,040
want to jump back in but uh to be to be

705
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,040
back of the grid and not being able to

706
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,040
fight for wins and so on i think i've

707
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,040
done my time and you know i'm happy to

708
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,040
watch it i'm still a fan about it but

709
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,040
i've i'm okay with not being there

710
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,040
anymore

711
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,040
i'm not too sure about your uh mention

712
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,040
of ferrari there in that trilogy of

713
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,040
competitive cars but let's leave that

714
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,040
let's leave that aside

715
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,040
you have to put ferry as a competitive

716
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,040
car whatever you know even if they're

717
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,040
not just put it in there

718
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,040
i have that though that i always

719
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,040
watching f1 always somehow still

720
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,040
accompanies me with a little bit of

721
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,040
negativity that i'm thinking like oh

722
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,040
uh i i could be there it's strange

723
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,040
because i'm totally fulfilled as well

724
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,040
but it still has always a tiny negative

725
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,040
there when i'm watching but i think it's

726
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,040
always going to be always going to be

727
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,040
like that yeah i mean you know i i i i'm

728
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,040
lucky to race in something else and i

729
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,040
guess i'm i'm finding a lot of pleasure

730

in in racing something else so really

731
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,040

yes this is a this is a comment of yours

746
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,040
about the halo

747
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,040

748
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,040
well

749
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,040
jean-thought came to see me in bahrain

750
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:24,040
on my hospital bed

751
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,040
and he said you remember what you say

752
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:28,040
about the halo and they say jean there's

753
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,040
only the dumbass that don't change their

754
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,040
mind

755
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:33,040
i have changed my mind

756
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:36,040
okay that's reassuring

757
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,040
i'm very glad to hear that

758
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,040
um so if it's

759
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,040
if it's okay with you i of course we'd

760
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,040
like to touch a little bit on on your

761
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,040
crash as well i hope i hope that's okay

762
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,040
for you and the crash you i mean you

763
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,040
were 27 seconds in the blazing fire and

764
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,040
then it was 67 g of of impact um

765
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,040
do you remember i hope that it's okay

766
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:59,040
for you that just to to to revisit it a

767
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,040
little bit i can imagine it's not so

768
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,040
easy but um i think the the listeners

769
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:05,040
would also appreciate from

770
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,040
getting an insight into some of those

771
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,040
experiences um

772
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,040
do you remember if you were scared at

773
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,040
any point as it was happening or or

774
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,040
after when you were sitting in the in

775
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,040
the fire

776
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,040
no actually no i think the

777
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,040
the first thing is between the the touch

778
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,040
with kiviat and the impact there's only

779
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,040
like six tenths of a second so you don't

780
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,040
really get the time to realize you're

781
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,040
gonna

782
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,040
hit the quad rail at that speed and then

783
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:32,040
surprisingly the impact for me wasn't

784
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:35,040
that bad you know 67 g is a lot but i

785
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,040
didn't feel like it was it was bad so i

786
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,040
i ended my silbed i'm ready to jump out

787
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:42,040
of the car and then i'm stuck and then i

788
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,040
you know i thought well i'm gonna wait

789
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,040
and then

790
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,040
they're gonna come and help me you know

791
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,040
i didn't know if it was upside down it's

792
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,040
night races there's no light in the

793
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,040
cockpit so you don't see anything you

794
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,040
don't know where you are

795
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,040
and um and then i realized there's fire

796
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,040
so oh okay no i can't wait and then i

797
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,040
try to jump out and jump out and jump

798
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,040
out and i i realize i'm completely stuck

799
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,040
and

800
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,040
and i realize the situation is is not

801
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,040
good

802
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,040
and then at one point i thought that was

803
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,040
it that was my day you know it was that

804
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,040
was game over

805
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,040
and uh that's why i say i was to me i

806
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,040
was i don't know five ten seconds from

807
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,040
being death dead uh

808
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:21,040
and and eventually i thought about my

809
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,040
three kids and i said no

810
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,040
i can't i can't leave them without that

811
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,040
and that's all i find the energy the

812
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,040
last energy to

813
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,040
to manage to find a solution to jump out

814
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,040
of the car even though you know i i

815
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:35,040
could i could feel my hands with burning

816
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,040
you know normally when you you touch

817
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,040
something hot you would you touch it and

818
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,040
remove it but i would i would keep my

819
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,040
hands and straight into the fire because

820
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,040
that's the only

821
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,040
grip i had to jump out of the car

822
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,040
and my foot was stuck and i was pulling

823
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,040
so hard on my leg that even my ankle

824
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,040
could have stayed there i wouldn't care

825
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:53,040
you know i just wanted to be out of the

826
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,040
car

827
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,040
and um

828
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:58,040
eventually made it

829
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,040
and

830
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,040
that that moment where i was sliding and

831
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,040
i knew i was off that was you know kind

832
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,040
of the best moment of you know of my

833
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,040
life maybe just because i was going to

834
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,040
leave um

835
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,040
and uh then i was in shock obviously

836
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:12,040
then i was in shock from from what

837
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,040
happened and seeing the fire and so on

838
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,040
and seeing what i went through um but

839
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,040
also you know it teach me a lot about me

840
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,040
that um

841
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,040
i knew i never give up in my life and i

842
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,040
never gave up in in my hopes and dreams

843
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,040
and and

844
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,040
wish to win races and to compete but uh

845
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,040
this experience being in in such a

846
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,040
difficult situation uh and not giving up

847
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:37,040
on and you know putting all you have in

848
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,040
your head fighting as high as hard as

849
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,040
you can to to escape that fire um show

850
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,040
me how strong it can be in in tough

851
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,040
times

852
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,040
i get uh i get shivers uh

853
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,040
listening to that because i also

854
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,040
remember sitting in front of the tv um

855
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,040
watching and of course i can relate a

856
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,040
tiny bit because of knowing how it feels

857
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:59,040
to sit in that cockpit in that space

858
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,040
um

859
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,040
and but you didn't you didn't have any

860
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,040
fear even when you started even the

861
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,040
moment you realized your foot was stuck

862
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,040
you weren't you weren't scared no

863
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,040
no i was i was not scared um

864
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,040
you know at that time you can't you

865
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:13,040
don't have the time to be scared

866
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,040
uh and and as i said at one point i

867
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,040
almost accepted that

868
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:20,040
that was it you know i would

869
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,040
i would be dead um it's quite it's quite

870
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,040
a strange feeling and that's obviously

871
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,040
something i had to work on with my

872
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,040
psychologist because say how can you

873
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,040
kind of accept you know and people say

874
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:31,040
oh you see all your life and so on no i

875
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,040
didn't see any of that i see

876
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,040
i see peace

877
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,040
and

878
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,040
and like

879
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,040
the body that that kind of relax and and

880
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,040
it is it is a very strange feeling um i

881
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,040
don't i don't

882
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,040
wish anyone to try it because you know

883
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,040
it's it's not not something you want to

884
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,040
go

885
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,040
but

886
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,040
it makes you

887
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,040
100 times stronger a thousand times

888
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,040
stronger

889
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,040
and i i read that you even had time to

890
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,040
relate to nikki lauda in those tenths of

891
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,040
a second is that that's really true

892
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,040
yeah that's true it's it's

893
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,040
when i undo the seat belt i start jump

894
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,040
out i don't i cannot do it and then i

895
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,040
realize i'm on fire and then i thought

896
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,040
about niki lauda and i said no no you

897
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,040
know i don't know why it's the third one

898
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,040
of the first footage that came into my

899
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,040
mind was with nikki being stuck in his

900
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:22,040
car on fire and and leaving the same

901
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,040
situation

902
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,040
i wish i could i wish i could speak with

903
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,040
him about it you know

904
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,040
because he was such a character i mean

905
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,040
you've been working with nikki

906
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,040
and

907
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:38,040
you know he was he was yeah to me was he

908
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,040
was the best legend of formula one no he

909
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,040

913
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,040
wait i just saw your helmet recently on

914
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,040
on the internet actually it was

915
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,040
incredibly burning how are how are your

916
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,040
hands doing now

917
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,040
well you know one is

918
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,040
the right

919
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,040
is good um

920
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,040
the left is a little bit less good

921
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,040
you know i i as i say i can almost live

922
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,040
normally

923
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,040
i can't i can't cope with cold uh i

924
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,040
cannot put sun for two years on it so i

925
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,040
need to put sun cream and gloves and so

926
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,040
on uh

927
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,040
it's painful 23 hours a day

928
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,040
uh i need to do rehab exercise every 10

929
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,040
minutes just to not lose mobility

930
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:21,040
so

931
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:25,040
it's not all pink it's not it's not nice

932
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,040
but i've got my two hands i can drive

933
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,040
car i can kill my kids i can

934
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:34,040
play with them and that's what matters

935
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,040
and um and how

936
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,040
how has this now has it changed you in

937
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,040
any way in in life having such a extreme

938
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:44,040
experience and knowing how vulnerable

939
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,040
life actually is do you catch yourself

940
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,040
now in life maybe spending that half

941
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,040
hour more with your kids when when you

942
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,040
would otherwise have done instagram or

943
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,040
is there any uh any change like that

944
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:57,040
yeah there's there's a beef on and after

945
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,040
29 11 20 you know for me that you can't

946
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,040
you can't go through an experience like

947
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,040
this and be the same

948
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,040
um so yes there's a there's a beef on an

949
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,040
after i know i enjoy life more more

950
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,040
small details as you say being with my

951
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,040
kids more

952
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,040
especially that this year with all the

953
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,040
travel sometimes i'm aware a little bit

954
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:22,040
longer and uh you know try just try to

955
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,040
we we take life for granted you know

956
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,040
exactly sometimes yeah

957
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,040
but it can go very quickly

958
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:31,040
and so you really you say there's really

959
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,040
a distinctive change in some moments of

960
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:36,040
your life now which as a result of that

961
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,040
yeah i even got myself my wife worried

962
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:40,040
at one point because i was after the

963
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:42,040
crash i was playing table tennis

964
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:44,040
and with my trainer in bahrain when i

965
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,040
was trying to come back for abu dhabi

966
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:49,040
and uh and we come back to to the room

967
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,040
and say who won i said i don't know we

968
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,040
didn't play for points she got worried

969
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,040
because i never played for not winning

970
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,040
and that happened

971
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,040
so now you just play for the enjoying

972
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,040
the moment in life yeah exactly

973
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,040
okay well that's powerful now that it's

974
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,040
really had such a such a lasting uh

975
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,040
lasting impact on than on on your life

976
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,040
in in that way yeah for sure it does

977
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,040
change everything and just the way also

978
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,040
the way i've seen on my racing and you

979
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:16,040
know i'm still doing it very

980
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,040
professionally and training and doing

981
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,040
things right but

982
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,040
also

983
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:23,040
i don't want to forget the fun of it

984
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,040
which which you know in professional

985
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,040
sport we tend to

986
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,040
um you say

987
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:29,040
you say in professional sport you tend

988
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:31,040
to forget the fun of it how to explain

989
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,040
that a little bit more detail than in

990
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:35,040
your f1 f1 career you say fun became

991
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,040
smaller and smaller and why yeah i think

992
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,040
so just because you know you've got the

993
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,040
pressure you need to perform um

994
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,040
and

995
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:46,040
you know at the end if you don't if you

996
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,040
don't win you don't have

997
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,040
that much fun that's what we do since

998
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,040
we're little you know and uh just

999
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:55,040
driving car is great but when you travel

1000
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,040
21 grand prize around the world

1001
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,040
get jet lag in every direction

1002
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,040
and you go to the race and you know your

1003
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:04,040
car is only capable of doing 16 or

1004
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,040
something like that

1005
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,040
even though driving

1006
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,040
f1 car is absolutely outstanding

1007
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,040
you get fun for one session or one run

1008
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,040
in free practice one and then you come

1009
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,040
back to the garage you see your three

1010
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,040
second of the pace and then you know

1011
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,040
it's gonna go

1012
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,040
and the fun just kind of disappears

1013
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,040
yeah no i can i can relate to that that

1014
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,040
um but but of course i had the element

1015
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,040
in the last couple of years of having a

1016
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:30,040
fantastic car but even then the fun

1017
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,040
becomes becomes smaller with time

1018
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:34,040
because there's just so much else

1019
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:36,040
happening so much so much expectation

1020
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,040
and pressure and

1021
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,040
and um and battles and politics and

1022
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,040
everything which unfortunately um just

1023
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:46,040
reduces that that fun element with time

1024
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,040
now for sure it's you know you had the

1025
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,040
best car but yeah you also had one of

1026
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,040
the best teammates to beat and uh

1027
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,040
at the end

1028
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,040
there's almost no room for fun it's not

1029
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,040
that we forget it is that there's almost

1030
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,040
no room for it you know just because

1031
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:02,040
every time you do something it has to be

1032
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,040
for the performance uh

1033
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:06,040
and to go for it and therefore

1034
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,040
it

1035
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,040
yeah the fun starts to go a little bit

1036
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,040
away

1037
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,040
yeah yeah um can i just i come back

1038
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,040
again to the work you've done with your

1039
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,040
psychologist now after the crash that

1040
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,040
you had

1041
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,040
last november um because i don't know if

1042
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,040
maybe there's a few things that we can

1043
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,040
pick out of course we haven't most of us

1044
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,040
haven't had anywhere near as extreme

1045
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,040
experiences but but maybe it's still

1046
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,040
relatable for some some some big

1047
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,040
failures we have in life or something

1048
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,040
else can you pick out like one

1049
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,040
particularly very interesting thing

1050
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,040
piece of work that you did with a

1051
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:38,040
psychologist to to work through that and

1052
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:41,040
and to uh to not um have any negativity

1053
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,040
from the crash to continue in your in

1054
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,040
your life is there one particular point

1055
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:48,040
well

1056
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,040
i think you know every every experience

1057
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,040
is is different and it's it's quite hard

1058
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,040
to

1059
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,040
relate uh something what i would say is

1060
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:59,040
you know that life is life is beautiful

1061
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:03,040
and worse living and and

1062
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,040
you know most of the time there is a

1063
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,040
solution and even though when i was in

1064
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,040
the fire they could look like there was

1065
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:10,040
no solution to to live

1066
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,040
at the end there were one and i had to

1067
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,040
dig deep

1068
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,040
and and to fight for it but uh

1069
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,040
at the end it worked so

1070
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,040
i i'm not the type of guy that goes on

1071
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,040
social media and gives you know uh live

1072
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,040
uh lessons or stuff that we can see uh

1073
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,040
sometimes um

1074
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,040
and i think we all we're all different

1075
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:31,040
in the way we we leave things and and

1076
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,040
you know the way we learn things about

1077
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,040
ourselves uh

1078
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,040
but

1079
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,040
you know i think one of the key in life

1080
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,040
generally is to never give up

1081
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,040
you know never give up on on your dream

1082
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,040
on your wishes on what you're doing and

1083
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:47,040
sometimes it just may

1084
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:50,040
not look good or may look hard and not

1085
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,040
be pretty but um

1086
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:52,040
i mean

1087
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,040
if you if you give up you never know

1088
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:56,040
what the answer is going to be the the

1089
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,040
positive really is that it changed my

1090
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:59,040
life for the best just because i

1091
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,040
realized that uh

1092
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,040
clothes are worse from from not having

1093
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,040
any more seconds so you know

1094
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,040
it's almost like a second birthday uh

1095
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,040
and every second is bonus so i guess

1096
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,040
that's

1097
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,040
but that's that's even more than the

1098
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:16,040
psychologist myself i i realized that

1099
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,040
and i need you know every morning i wake

1100
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,040
up and i realize and i remind me myself

1101
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,040
that i'm here and that is you know that

1102
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,040
that is lucky to be here

1103
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,040
um

1104
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:29,040
so yeah life life is worth believing

1105
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,040
that's really nice to hear but then at

1106
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,040
the same time now you signed for

1107
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,040
dalecoin racing in uh in uh indy cars so

1108
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:37,040
are you then a little bit of a nut case

1109
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,040
or what because uh you're coming from

1110
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,040
this and you're going into a racing

1111
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,040
that's even more dangerous because

1112
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,040
you're racing on ovals where we know

1113
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,040
unfortunately that the the risk is

1114
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,040
higher um

1115
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:58,040
i mean

1116
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,040
you're comfortable now or after that was

1117
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,040
it how was the feeling like before you

1118
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,040
got back into the first time in the

1119
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,040
racing car in del coin racing were you a

1120
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:07,040
bit like i don't know if i'm gonna

1121
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,040
be able to do this or

1122
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,040
you know i was i was never worried for

1123
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,040
testing um i

1124
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,040
knew jumping back in the car because i

1125
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,040
did it in bahrain i wanted to to sit in

1126
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,040
the in the house

1127
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:21,040
yeah thursday

1128
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,040
yeah i think it was thursday um so five

1129
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,040
days after the crash and i felt i didn't

1130
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,040
feel any

1131
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:30,040
anything strange anything unusual

1132
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:32,040
i wasn't worried sitting in a car we you

1133
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,040
know in in motorsport we accept the risk

1134
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,040
this is

1135
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,040
it's since we do go-karts you know i

1136
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:40,040
broke my collarbone in go-karts and

1137
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,040
and and we have had crashes and things

1138
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:45,040
and we know it it's dangerous and and we

1139
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,040
always try to make with the gpd and so

1140
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,040
on we always try to make the the sport

1141
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:51,040
safer from the bottom of the ladder

1142
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,040
um

1143
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,040
obviously there are things a little bit

1144
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,040
different you mentioned overs i'm not

1145
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,040
doing the the speed west so i'm not

1146
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,040
doing texas no indy 500 which is one of

1147
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,040
the biggest race in the world that

1148
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,040
obviously i would like to have it on my

1149
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,040
palmaris but uh

1150
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,040
it's not so much for me it's more for my

1151
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:10,040
my family and my kids and my wife not to

1152
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:12,040
put them into the situation again

1153
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,040
because you know when you drive at 400

1154
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,040
kph and there's a crash it's a big one

1155
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,040
most of the time we touch with the guys

1156
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,040
they jump out okay

1157
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,040
but for a moment you can you see the

1158
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,040
crash and you don't know and i don't

1159
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,040
want to put them through uh that that

1160
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,040
face you know

1161
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,040
the risk we accepted i mean

1162
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:32,040
formula you cannot drive a car 330 kph

1163
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,040
next to each other

1164
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,040
fighting the limits driving through the

1165
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:38,040
streets of monaco flat out

1166
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,040
without knowing that there is the risk

1167
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,040
is involved and you know we accept it we

1168
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,040
measure it we're not crazy as you say we

1169
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,040
uh

1170
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,040
we

1171
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,040
you know it is our life you know living

1172
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,040
on the edge but knowing

1173
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,040
which which side is the good side i

1174
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,040
really respect also how you're showing

1175
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,040
your vulnerability now in this moment

1176
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:59,040
how you're saying hey i actually don't

1177
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,040
know how it's going to be when i'll be

1178
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,040
in the middle of the race start with

1179
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,040
with 24 other cars going uh going flat

1180
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:07,040
out in the racing car on a rolling race

1181
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,040
start no which is

1182
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,040
more crazy than the f1 race starts um so

1183
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,040
i really appreciate that and at the same

1184
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,040
time it's great to see the courage of

1185
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,040
the courage that you're that you're

1186
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,040
taking to just put you into that

1187
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:20,040
situation and just go for it um

1188
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,040
very very very strong

1189
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,040
yeah i'm passionate about it i love

1190
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:26,040
racing and you know even on my hospital

1191
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,040
bed the first the first mission was

1192
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,040
trying to be back in the car in abu

1193
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,040
dhabi

1194
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:34,040
and uh never really i thought about

1195
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:36,040
quitting you know and a lot of people

1196
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,040
would have understood if i said you know

1197
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,040
i retired at the end of my career

1198
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,040
it would have been almost normal

1199
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:45,040
but we we are not normal you know we

1200
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,040
we built to be champions we built to be

1201
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,040
to be races to be competitors

1202
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,040
and as long as you have that wish that

1203
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,040
you want you are not done with what you

1204
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,040
love doing then uh

1205
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:58,040
you know it's hard to stop and as i say

1206
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:00,040
formula one for me the chapter is it's

1207
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:02,040
turned and

1208
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:04,040
i'm happy with what i've done i don't

1209
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,040
regret anything

1210
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,040
but mother spot i am i don't feel like

1211
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,040
i'm done with it and if i would stop now

1212
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,040
i would feel always something a bit

1213
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,040
you know not so positive

1214
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:16,040
what is for you like the dream targets

1215
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,040
one or two targets left in in

1216
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,040
motorsports it would be winning uh

1217
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,040
winning indycar championship of course

1218
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,040
and yeah that would be nice uh le mans

1219
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:26,040
24 hours endurance racing you know

1220
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,040
sharing the cars with teammates uh

1221
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,040
that's something that i

1222
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,040
i did last year the mall 24s on esports

1223
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,040
and

1224
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,040
with my team and my teammates and we

1225
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,040
crossed the finish line and we finished

1226
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,040
fourth

1227
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,040
and it was actually super special to

1228
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,040
share that moment with with the guys

1229
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,040
even though we weren't in the same room

1230
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,040
but we were talking and chatting on

1231
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,040
discord and it was a it was a special

1232
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,040
moment and i thought that that day i

1233
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,040
thought you know what i think i've had

1234
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,040
enough of trying to be as fast as i can

1235
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,040
on my own no i want to make sure that i

1236
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,040
go fast with my team you know my

1237
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,040
teammates my car goes fast and endurance

1238
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,040
is definitely something that i want to

1239
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,040
do yeah that's really nice i've heard so

1240
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,040
much about that i'm from f1 drivers

1241
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:10,040
going to indycar and saying it's uh to

1242
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,040
to le mans saying it's such a refreshing

1243
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,040
experience because in f1 it's so ego ego

1244
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,040
focused and ego driven it's just you and

1245
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,040
and on your own against the others

1246
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:23,040
feeling wise even though you have a team

1247
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,040
um and that's really refreshing to share

1248
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,040
the the resp the responsibility with

1249
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,040
other drivers like that as you were

1250
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,040
saying sounds really uh sounds like a

1251
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:32,040
really nice environment

1252
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,040
yeah no for sure it's definitely

1253
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,040
something i want to try and you know

1254
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,040
indycar has got

1255
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,040
it's got a very different mentality as

1256
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:40,040
well from from formula one it's a single

1257
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:42,040
seater but there's such a

1258
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,040
i mean everything is open you

1259
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,040
i went to the first test of the season

1260
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,040
and the car was being set up on the

1261
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,040
on the parking

1262
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:53,040
but our car next to a rail racing team

1263
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,040
next to penske

1264
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,040
and there's no tents no bugs no hiding

1265
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,040
and they're like no i mean they're all

1266
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,040
the same cars best the best one does the

1267
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,040
best job on track and that's it and you

1268
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,040
share barbecue in the evening with the

1269
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:07,040
drivers and then obviously in the

1270
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,040
morning you put your race helmet and

1271
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,040
then it's it's fighting and beating them
